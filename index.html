About I’ve been building things for the web for nearly 20 years, and I get deep satisfaction from unblocking teams and individuals so they can grow, collaborate, and thrive. Wherever possible I try to take an integrative, holistic approach with a clear focus on rapid iteration, short feedback loops, transparent values, and high quality decision-making. Having helped build GitHub (2012–2015) and Intercom (2017–2021), I’ve designed and shaped many core features of high-visibility products and high-traffic workflows, as well as growing and leading teams to do the same. As a student in Seth Godin’s altMBA program—a four-week online intensive leadership workshop—I was awarded the Perkins Prize for most outstanding body of work, and was invited to join the coaching team (2016–2018) where I co-led subsequent EMEA cohorts.

  <h3>Where I’m from</h3>
  <p class="content-prose">
    I’m originally from <strong>New Zealand</strong>,
    where I grew up in the <strong>Bay of Islands</strong>,
    before moving to <strong>Auckland</strong> to begin school.
    The first significant chunk of my schooling was in the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldorf_education" target="_blank">Waldorf/Steiner</a> system,
    which I credit to a large extent with my ability to learn rapidly and think creatively.
    I finished off my schooling in <strong>Australia</strong>,
    and worked freelance while <strong>studying remotely</strong>
    to complete an IT degree, majoring in <strong>network security</strong>.
  </p>
  <p class="content-prose">
    In various past lives I’ve also lived in <strong>Northern Ireland</strong> and
    <strong>Scotland</strong>—in addition to having travelled to <strong>27 countries</strong>—so
    I’ve wound up with a funky accent you’ll probably struggle to place.
    <strong>London, UK</strong> has been a wonderful home for me since 2016,
    and I intend to continue living here for the foreseeable future.
  </p>

  <h3>What I believe</h3>
  <p class="content-prose">
    We live in a <em>constantly changing</em> world, and I believe a future <strong>very different</strong> from today will be upon us sooner than we think.
    I’m also keenly aware that:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>I’m effectively the epitome of privilege on most dimensions you can think of.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>In the cosmic Grand Scheme of Things™ my life is almost entirely insignificant.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p class="content-prose">
    With that in mind, I believe it is our collective duty to use what little influence we have (through our work or after-hours)
    to nudge things towards a <strong>more inclusive future</strong>
    which better represents the interests of those less privileged than you and I,
    and to be <strong>good ancestors</strong> for the <em>countless</em> future generations yet to be born.
  </p>
  <p class="content-prose">
    I’d also like to believe that’s achievable while having an <strong><em>absurd amount of fun</em></strong>.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Where I'm going</h3>
  <p class="content-prose">
    To give you a sense of what all that translates to in real terms, and the directions I’m headed in general,
    here’s a short list of some things I’m actively pursuing:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Web3, blockchain technology, CRDTs, and decentralised collaboration models.</p></li>
    <li><p>Fractal mathematics, hyperbolic geometry, and generative digital art.</p></li>
    <li><p>Neuroplasticity, neurodiversity, and psychedelic-assisted therapies.</p></li>
    <li><p>Community building, and alternative approaches to relationships.</p></li>
    <li><p>Data visualisation, projection mapping, and film photography.</p></li>
    <li><p>Studying Zen Buddhism, stoic philosophy, and mindfulness.</p></li>
    <li><p>3D printing, CNC machining, DIY electronics and robotics.</p></li>
    <li><p>Cryptography, network security, and algorithm design.</p></li>
    <li><p>Music production, sound design, and acoustics.</p></li>
    <li><p>AI/ML, deep learning, and neural networks.</p></li>
    <li><p>Sorting lists by line length, apparently.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p class="content-prose">
    If it sounds like we’re going in a similar direction, I’d love to hear from you.
